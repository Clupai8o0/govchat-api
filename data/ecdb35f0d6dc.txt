While the Australian Government provides substantial funding for schools in Australia and plays a leadership role in setting and advocating for national education priorities, it does not have a direct role in the administration or operation of Australian schools. State and territory governments have constitutional responsibility for the operation and regulation of schools in their jurisdictions and can be contacted on these links.
