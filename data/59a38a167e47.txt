Census Reports










The APS Employee Census is an annual survey which is used to collect confidential attitude and opinion information from APS employees on issues in the workplace. It is an opportunity for APS employees to share their experiences of working in the APS.



On this page:






Agencies that participate in the APS Employee Census are required to publicly release their Census agency level report and an accompanying action plan. This release takes place in November and coincides with the tabling of the State of the Service Report in Parliament.
