Through education and learning, we change lives – opening a world of possibilities for children and young people to gain the skills and knowledge to fulfil their dreams from school through to higher education.
By supporting a strong early childhood education system, we help children build social and behavioural skills to help them prepare for school.
For parents and carers, we provide access to affordable child care to help them participate in the workforce or pursue other opportunities.
Integral to our success is empowering First Nations peoples to have a voice in decisions about their education and delivering on the Closing the Gap Priority Reforms and socio-economic outcomes.
Through our priority work, we will transform the education system for the future and contribute to Australia’s economic success and social wellbeing—where no one is held back, and no one is left behind.
