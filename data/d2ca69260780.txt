Life Education
Australia



The Australian Government supports Life Education Australia (Life Ed) to provide health and safety education to around 700,000 primary school aged children each year.
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, the Government provided Life Ed $1 million to support the operation of its national office.
As part of the 2019-20 Budget, the Government funded Life Ed $4.4 million to develop new educational resources to support students in the transition from primary to secondary school (Guide to Thrive) and new social and emotional learning resources and to conduct an independent evaluation of the program.
As part of the 2022-23 Budget, the Government will provide an additional $6 million over four years from 2022-23 to support the ongoing operation of Life Ed Australia, the development of additional online safety modules for younger children, adapting existing respectful relationships and consent education materials, and implementing recommendations arising from an evaluation of the program.
